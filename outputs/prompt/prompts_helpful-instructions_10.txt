I can, but maybe I should begin by telling you that a typical game consists of 2 players and 6 or 8 horseshoes.

Great question! That’s a really useful skill to cultivate, it can bring peace, calm, and happiness. I’m glad you want to teach your kids about it.

Sure. I believe you’ll need a copy of the marina rules and regulations, since some of those details will likely determine what forms you’ll need to fill out. It looks like there’s a quick way to get a copy of the rules by phone, since you might be able to get the contact information for the harbormaster from your yacht club. If you get a hold of that person, you’ll also be

You could store the food in a refrigerator, the top cupboards in your kitchen, the freezer, or even in a hole in the ground.

That depends on the 9 year old, but if they like thrillers or mysteries then maybe something like “The Body in the Bog” or “The Boy Who Followed Ripley.” For more modern, female-written fiction I might recommend “Jane Eyre” or “Frankenstein.”

How old is the car? What is the mileage? What do you typically put in it? What model car is it?
[1, 1602, 1571, 349, 272, 1253, 28804, 1824, 349, 272, 13677, 465, 28804, 1824, 511, 368, 9566, 1658, 297, 378, 28804, 1824, 2229, 1253, 349, 378, 28804]


I don’t know exactly how you would do that, but there’s an easy way to try. You could build or buy a squirrel feeder and use it for this purpose.

Ooof, it’s really hard to answer this question!  But I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you my answer, and then I’ll ask you what you think of it, okay?

I believe there are products that will work at removing odors.  Can you tell me what’s going on?

Gift cards are perfect for gift-giving! I have my favorite on my personal Wishlist, but you can also just have an Amazon, Walmart, Target, or Apple Store card for a unique and personal gift.
